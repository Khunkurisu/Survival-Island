/*		This is the readme file for the Survival Island game in the Panthians series.  Please read thoroughly.

Hotkeys:
	WASD move.  W = north, A = west, S = south, D = east.  W+A = northwest, W+D = northeast, S+A = southwest, S+D = southeast.
	C opens crafting menu (only if you have the ability to craft something).
	B opens your bag.
	G gets the current time and date in game.
	M opens the make-some-magic prototype menu.
	P opens the update logs.
	Click a known spell (shown under equipment in top right inventory window) to 'prime' it.
	R casts primed spell. (note: beams currently stop casting if you move or press 'R' again-- same goes for channeled spells.)

Known bugs:
	1) Occasionally the cost of a spell will be a large, negative number.  Working on fix.
	2) Changing number of trees set to spawn only works in large numbers or as a 0. Setting to 0 no trees spawn.  Anything above that
		spawns a random number of trees in the hundreds.

Error reporting:
	Please upload your world.log file as-is to Google Drive then send a link to me via facebook/skype/discord/steam so that I may review any
	errors you may encounter.
